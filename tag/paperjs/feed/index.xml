<p><a style="color: #428bca;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Lewitt" target="_blank">Sol LeWitt</a> was a conceptual artist whose works are an important precendent for many of the &#8220;creative coding&#8221; projects produced today. His large-scale and numerous <a style="color: #428bca;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Lewitt#Wall_drawings" target="_blank">Wall Drawings</a> consisted of instruction sets — sometimes quite detailed — which were executed by others. The variations in understanding and application of these rule sets by human agents led to beautiful works of art, executed by numerous anonymous workers.</p>
<p>The Wall Drawings are also procedural, in the computational sense. This project is a riff on the Wall Drawings.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You are invited to participate. Each drawing is a work in progress, drawn by visitors. As you browse, please contribute. Each drawing appears with instructions, written by other visitors.</span></p>
<p>Be nice, be responsible. Drawings flouting instructions will be deleted and their authors banned.</p>
